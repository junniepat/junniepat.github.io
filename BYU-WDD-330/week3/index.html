        <li><a href="quiz.html">Quiz</a></li>
        <li>I learned how to create an object and assign it values.</li>
        <li>I learned about rounding functions for math objects that I 
            haven't used before in programming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Why would you use a name in an object with a space and not just capitalize the second name?</li>
    </ol>   
    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            When talking about differences in JSON the book says: "Permitted values
            are double quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and 
            objects" The example then shows that a string is double quoted, but 
            numbers and booleans are not. That is a little confusing to me. It seems
            like numbers aren't quoted, but strings are, but one of the key differences
            they state makes it seem like all values should be double quoted. 
        </p>

           A couple of things that I picked up on in the reading was that there are special
           characters that can help an shorten the RegExp. I also realized that there are math
           expressions for advanced trigonometery functions. I have used math expressions 
           in other programming languages, but I never have used Trig functions.
