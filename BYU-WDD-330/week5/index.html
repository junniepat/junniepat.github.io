        <ol>
            <li>Can SCSS always be used for CSS or should it only be used when you needs 
                to use variables an mixins?

        <h3>NOTES</h3>
        <div>
            <p>This week I completed the TODO tutorial. It was a very interesting project that was
                really fun to complete. I created a TODO list by following a 2 hr video. I took me 
                much longer than two hours, because I had to go over stuff and figure out quite a 
                few problems that came up. In the end I was able to complete the app.        
            </p>
            <p>One of the difficult things from this week was the group activity. It was a lot of 
                information and things to go through. I do kind of understand what needs to be done,
                but it is/was a lot of stuff to do!
