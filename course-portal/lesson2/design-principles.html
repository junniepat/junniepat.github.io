                <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
                <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/applying-hicks-law-to-web-design-free-example-wireframes/" target="_blank">Link to an article</a>

                <h4>Noon.com is an example I found of hick's law</h4>
                <p>
                    Hick’s law basically states that the time it takes to make a decision increases as 
                    the number of alternatives increase. <br/><br/>

                    In Noon just like most e-commerce web apps the application of Hick's law is been used
                    it would be a daunting task for each user to go through the menu one item by a time.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So they went on to simplify into categories, and have alternatives as the user scroll down
                    the website.

                <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
                <h4>Slack.com</h4>
                <p>
                    Slack's website is a good example of a good utilization of white space add 
                    clean design. It gives space for the users eye's to rest inbetween reading the available 
                    content on the screen.

                    <br/><br/>

                    “White Space in design composition is same as use of Silence in a musical composition. 
                    Without proportionate use of Silence, music is unstructured; some may call it noise. 
                    Similarly, without White Space, design is unstructured and difficult to consume”

                <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3>
                <h4>BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.com/">Web link</a></h4>

                <p>
                    The principle of proximity states that elements that are associated with each other should
                    be placed closely (grouped together), and vice versa.
                    <br/><br/>
                    BBC website is an example of Proximity in design as they put elements that are associated with
                    each other together, making it easier for the reader to quickly correlate the information being read.
