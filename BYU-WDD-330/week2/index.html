            This week the reading was covered some things I had been 
            introduced from earlier programming classes. I was even familiar
            with Javascript functions. It was good to get some reading on 
            variables and what the best way to use them is. I think I got
            the answer to my questions about assigning variables. I think the 
            answer is to use let.

            One thing I used this week with inputs that I haven't used much
            before is placeholders. That is a way to inform the user what they 
            are to enter. This can help with mobile design and presrving space 
            when it would take up to much space to use labels.
