    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Should all validation be checked before submitting the FORM HTML or checked after the form is submitted?</li>
        <li>Is there a point where the data is to large, or a certain type that it is better to check it elsewhere?</li>
    </ol>   
    <h3>NOTES</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
           One thing that always comes to my mind when reading about forms is how much validation should be taken care
           of by the HTML? I wonder if there is a point where you can check for possible minor descrepancies when your
           form is validated.
