    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
     The name of the state derives from its capital city, Enugu. The word "Enugu" (from Enu Ugwu) means "the top of the hill". 
     The first European settlers arrived in the area in 1909, led by a British mining engineer named Albert Kitson. In his quest for silver,
      he discovered coal in the Udi Ridge which is why the state is regarded as coal city state. 
      
      <br/><br/>
      The Colonial Governor of Nigeria Frederick 
      Lugard took a keen interest in the discovery, and by 1914 the first shipment of coal was made to Britain. As mining activities increased 
      in the area, a permanent cosmopolitan settlement emerged, supported by a railway system. Enugu acquired township status in 1917 and became strategic
       to British interests. Foreign businesses began to move into Enugu, the most notable of 
     which were John Holt, Kingsway Stores, the British Bank of West Africa and the United Africa Company.

               <h1 style="color: var(--blue-color);">About The Chamber</h1>
               <p>
                A Chamber of Commerce is an association of businessmen and women who have the common goal of protecting and improving the business 
                environment in which they operate for their benefit and that of the community. A Chamber of Commerce is usually governed by private law 
                and normally is a voluntary or compulsory association of businessmen and women depending on the law of the land.
                <br /><br />
                In Nigeria, just as in the United States of America, membership is voluntary while in France, etc, it is compulsory.

                Membership of the Chamber is open to all businessmen and women who have the desire to come together and work for the growth of business 
                depending on the strength of the organization. Membership can also be multiple depending on the location of business concerns.

   

               </p>

           <div class="QuickDescription-item">
               <p>
                Enugu Chamber of Commerce is a non-profit making organization of business professionals who have joined together:

                To promote the civic, commercial and industrial progress in Enugu state and environs. To be a non-partisan association.
                To be a major factor in promoting and enhancing the social and economic climate, in which we all live and work.
                Think of the Chamber as a catalyst, a common vehicle through which business, professional and individuals work together 
                for the common good of the community. A better community means a better quality of life for all
                <br /><br />
                The Chamber works for a better Nigeria, particularly Enugu State.

                Ensure the economic condition of the area is at a level where the business will risk resources in the hope of making a profit.
                The Chamber understands that a healthy business community is necessary to produce the many benefits we enjoy.
                To succeed in the above goals, jobs must be provided and wealth produced to finance the social and cultural attributes that make us proud of our community.
