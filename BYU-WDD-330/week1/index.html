    <h3>NOTES</h3>

            This week the reading was on how important it is to do mobile
            first when designing a web page. The increase in mobile devices 
            has skyrocketed and has to be taken into account in your design. 
            The biggest need is to make your site comfortable for the user 
            experience. They have to be able to scroll through your site and
            enjoy there time there and not be annoyed at ads and difficult to 
            navigate content.    
        </p>
        <p>
            An idea to increase user experience are in ads don't use pop ups.
            A way around this is make ads smaller, and have part of the ad show
            as the user scrolls down the page. You could also have the ad be 
            bigger if the user clicks on the ad.
